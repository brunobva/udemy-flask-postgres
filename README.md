### This code was made using the data from the url below:
https://www.udemy.com/course/create-a-web-application-with-python-flask-postgresql/learn/lecture/22014352?start=0#overview

I've just improved using docker for the python app and also to the database Postgres.
Next step will be add it to an pipeline and let it work with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

# It works just for local but you can use it on Cloud also :)

#### For any concern, help or new ideas, please let me know!
